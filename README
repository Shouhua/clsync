Notify engines:

	It's suppported fanotify and inotify engines. However fanotify was not ready
	at the moment of the code writting, so I was have to temporary fallback
	to inotify.

	I've freezed code that uses fanotify until it the fanotify will be ready.

	The reason, why I didn't continue to use fanotify, that it was unable to
	catch some events, like "directory creation" or "file deletion".
